# Generating Binary Decision Diagram of Adders with Different Structures with BUDDY Software
In this project, we implemented three diffrent adder structure in c++ then we used BUDDY, the application which generates Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), in order to draw our circuit BDD and analyze it.
This project is done as the mid-term project of Methodologies and Algorithms for ESL Design Automation (MSEDL) course.
This codes must make in Linux.
